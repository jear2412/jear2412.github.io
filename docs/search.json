    "text": "I am a doctoral researcher and research assistant at TU Dortmund University, where I work with Paul Bürkner. Previously, I was a research assistant at the Cluster of Excellence SimTech at the University of Stuttgart. I hold a Master’s degree in Probability and Statistics from the Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT) in Guanajuato, Mexico, where I was supervised by Andrés Christen.\nMy research interests include Bayesian inference, Bayesian computation, prior specification, probabilistic programming, and high-dimensional statistics.\nI regularly review submissions for journals such as the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Statistics in Medicine, and Applied Statistics, among others.\nFeel free to get in touch if you’re interested in collaborating or would like to discuss my work."
