::: {#about-heading}
I am a doctoral researcher and research assistant at [TU Dortmund University](https://compstat.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/), working with [Paul Bürkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io). Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Cluster of Excellence SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de) at the University of Stuttgart. I hold a Master’s degree in Probability and Statistics from the [Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT)](https://ppe.cimat.mx) in Guanajuato, Mexico, where I was supervised by [Andrés Christen](https://www.cimat.mx/~jac/).

My research focuses on Bayesian computation, prior specification, probabilistic programming, and high-dimensional statistics. My work has been published in journals such as Bayesian Analysis, Statistics and Computing, and the Electronic Journal of Statistics, and is also available as preprints on arXiv. A central theme of my work is using interpretable, problem-specific quantities as the foundation for constructing joint prior distributions in high-dimensional models. I also create methods for controlling model complexity, improving uncertainty quantification, and enhancing model validation through simulation-based techniques. To help researchers apply modern Bayesian methods effectively in their own work, I teach and organize workshops on Bayesian data analysis and the use of [`brms`](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/), an R package for Bayesian regression modeling using the probabilistic programming language [`Stan`](https://mc-stan.org/). I also collaborate with applied scientists in fields such as biostatistics and the natural sciences, adapting and implementing these methods in real-world studies. I am currently exploring **postdoctoral opportunities** in these areas and welcome discussions about potential collaborations or openings.

I’m always happy to connect. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:javier.aguilarr@icloud.com) if you’d like to discuss Bayesian methods, potential collaborations, or just exchange ideas.


<!-- I am a reviewer for journals such as the *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society*, *Statistics in Medicine*, and *Applied Statistics*, among others. -->
