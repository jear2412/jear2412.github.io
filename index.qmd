::: {#about-heading}
I am a doctoral researcher and research assistant at [TU Dortmund University](https://compstat.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/), where I work with [Paul Bürkner](https://paul-buerkner.github.io). Previously, I was a research assistant at the [Cluster of Excellence SimTech](https://www.simtech.uni-stuttgart.de) at the University of Stuttgart. I hold a Master’s degree in Probability and Statistics from the Center for Research in Mathematics ([CIMAT](https://ppe.cimat.mx)) in Guanajuato, Mexico, where I was supervised by [Andrés Christen](https://www.cimat.mx/~jac/).

My research interests include Bayesian inference, Bayesian computation, prior specification, probabilistic programming, and high-dimensional statistics.

I am a reviewer for journals such as the *Journal of the Royal Statistical Society*, *Statistics in Medicine*, and *Applied Statistics*, among others.

I am currently looking for postdoctoral opportunities in Bayesian statistics or related areas. Feel free to [get in touch](mailto:javier.aguilarr@icloud.com) if you're interested in collaborating or would like to discuss my work.
